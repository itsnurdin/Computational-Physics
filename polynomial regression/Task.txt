Dynamic viscosity of water µ(10.3 N.s/m^2) is related to temperature T(°C) in the following manner:

T	µ
0	1.787
5	1.519
10	1.307
20	1.002
30	0.7975
40	0.6529

a)	Plot this data.
b)	Use linear interpolation to predict µ at T = 7.5 °C.
c)	Use polynomial regression to fit a parabola to the data in order to make the same  prediction.
